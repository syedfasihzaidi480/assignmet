#TASK 2 
#Weather Application

This weather application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It provides users with the ability to search for weather conditions in different cities, view current weather details, and access a 5-day forecast. The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

##Development Approach:

###HTML: 
The HTML structure is designed to provide a user-friendly interface with sections for displaying current weather, search functionality, and the 5-day forecast.

###CSS:
CSS is utilized to style the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. Media queries are used to adapt the design for different screen sizes.

###JavaScript:
JavaScript is used to handle user interactions such as city search, fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and updating the UI with the retrieved data.

###jQuery:
jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, enhancing the development process. It is used alongside JavaScript to streamline coding tasks.

##OpenWeatherMap API:
The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This API provides accurate and up-to-date weather information for cities worldwide, including current conditions and forecasts.

##Fetching and Displaying Weather Data:

When a user enters a city name and initiates a search, the application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified city name.

The API returns a JSON response containing weather data for the requested city, including current conditions and a 5-day forecast.

JavaScript/JQuery processes the JSON response, extracting relevant information such as temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.

The retrieved weather data is then dynamically displayed on the application interface, updating the current weather section and the 5-day forecast accordingly.
