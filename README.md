#TASK 2 
#Weather Application

This weather application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It provides users with the ability to search for weather conditions in different cities, view current weather details, and access a 5-day forecast. The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

##Development Approach:

###HTML: 
The HTML structure is designed to provide a user-friendly interface with sections for displaying current weather, search functionality, and the 5-day forecast.

###CSS:
CSS is utilized to style the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. Media queries are used to adapt the design for different screen sizes.

###JavaScript:
JavaScript is used to handle user interactions such as city search, fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and updating the UI with the retrieved data.

###jQuery:
jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, enhancing the development process. It is used alongside JavaScript to streamline coding tasks.

##OpenWeatherMap API:
The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This API provides accurate and up-to-date weather information for cities worldwide, including current conditions and forecasts.

##Fetching and Displaying Weather Data:

When a user enters a city name and initiates a search, the application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified city name.

The API returns a JSON response containing weather data for the requested city, including current conditions and a 5-day forecast.

JavaScript/JQuery processes the JSON response, extracting relevant information such as temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.

The retrieved weather data is then dynamically displayed on the application interface, updating the current weather section and the 5-day forecast accordingly.

#TASK 4(Rock,Paper, and Scissor)
#Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Rock, Paper, Scissors game is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It supports single-player mode against the computer, validates user choices, and includes a scoring mechanism for an interactive gaming experience.

#Approach:

##HTML Structure:

The HTML structure consists of buttons for rock, paper, and scissors choices, a display area for the user's choice, computer's choice, and game result, and a scoreboard to track the score.
##CSS Styling:

CSS is used to style the game interface, including buttons, display area, scoreboard, and overall layout.
Styling is applied to enhance the visual appeal and create an engaging user interface.
##JavaScript and jQuery Functionality:

JavaScript and jQuery are employed to implement the game logic and interactivity.
Event listeners are added to the buttons to capture user input and trigger game actions.
Functions are created to validate user choices, generate random computer choices, determine the game result, and update the scoreboard.
##Single-player Mode:

The game supports single-player mode where the user plays against the computer.
Upon user selection, the computer randomly selects its choice, and the game result is determined based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
##Scoring Mechanism:

A scoring mechanism is implemented to keep track of the user's score.
The scoreboard is updated after each game to display the current score.
Challenges:

##Random Computer Choice:

Generating a random choice for the computer while ensuring fairness and unpredictability posed a challenge. This was addressed by using JavaScript's Math.random() function.
Game Result Determination:

Determining the game result based on user and computer choices required careful implementation of conditional statements to cover all possible scenarios (rock vs. rock, paper vs. paper, etc.).
Responsive Design:

Ensuring the game interface is responsive across different screen sizes and devices required thorough testing and adjustment of CSS styles.
##How to Run:

Clone Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone [repository URL].
Open HTML File:
